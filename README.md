## Feature Design

  1. State Management Container Design
        The design of the state management container allows different components in the application to share state and maintain consistency of the state throughout the application's lifecycle, which needs to be considered in the design of the state management container.
  2. Defining Actions
        Available operations should be clearly defined, such as setting data, updating state, or sending API requests, etc. This helps maintain consistency of the application code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
  3. Unified API
        Defining a unified API interface for state management is a good way to implement it, which can be achieved by using APIs that handle and update states based on specific events. This makes managing the state of multiple data sources easier.
  4. Middleware Design
        Middleware allows you to execute custom code at different points in the application, such as before or after sending API requests. This helps maintain consistency of the application code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
  5. DevTools
        DevTools is a tool for debugging applications, which can be used to view changes in state throughout the application's lifecycle. This helps debug the application and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
  6. Code Splitting
        Code splitting is a technique for dividing an application's code into multiple chunks that can be loaded on demand. This helps improve application performance and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
  7. Server-Side Rendering
        Server-side rendering is a technique for pre-rendering an application on the server and then sending it to the client. This helps improve application performance and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
